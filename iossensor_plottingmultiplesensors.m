%% Acquire and Plot Angular Velocity and Orientation Data from Your Apple(R) iOS Device
%
% This example shows how to plot data from multiple sensors on an Apple iOS 
% device together in one timeline. Measurements of angular velocity and 
% orientation will be collected from the device and plotted over absolute 
% time. This will allow correlations between data from two sensors to be
% visualized based on the actual time of measurement.

%% Setting up the connection to your mobile device
% In order to receive data from an Apple iOS device in MATLAB(R), you will 
% need the MATLAB Mobile(TM) app (version 2.0). You can download this app 
% from App Store(SM).

%% 
% Use MATLAB Connector to allow connection between your desktop MATLAB 
% session and MATLAB Mobile on your Apple iOS device. Your device must be 
% able to connect to your desktop, either by being on the same network, 
% using a VPN, or through a similar configuration.
%
% Execute the |connector| command with a password of your choice.

connector on yourpassword;

%%
% Your computer's DNS name and IP address are displayed on
% the MATLAB Command Window, along with a test link. Click on the test link
% to ensure that your desktop is ready to connect. The last digits after
% the colon on the test link correspond to the port that has been opened.

%% 
% Now you can connect MATLAB Mobile to your desktop.
%
% If you are launching MATLAB Mobile for the first time, select Connect to 
% Your Computer. If you previously connected to the cloud or a different 
% desktop, go to the Settings screen and select Add a Computer from the 
% Connect to Your Computers section.
% On the Add a Computer screen, enter the DNS name or IP address that was
% displayed in the previous step. Then, enter the Connector password that 
% you previously specified, as well as the port that was opened.
% Finally, press the Connect button.
% MATLAB Mobile should now be connected to your desktop MATLAB session.

%% Create a link to your mobile device
% Use the |mobiledev| command to create an object that represents your
% mobile device.

m = mobiledev

%%
% The displayed output should show |Connected: 1|, indicating that the 
% |mobiledev| object has successfully established a connection to the app.
%% Prepare for data acquisition from multiple sensors
% Use the appropriate |mobiledev| properties to enable sensors on the
% device.

   m.AccelerationSensorEnabled = 1;
m.AngularVelocitySensorEnabled = 1;
       m.MagneticSensorEnabled = 1;
    m.OrientationSensorEnabled = 1;
       m.PositionSensorEnabled = 1;

%% Start acquiring data
% After enabling the sensors, the Sensors screen of MATLAB Mobile will show
% the current data measured by the sensors. The |Logging| property allows 
% you to begin sending sensor data to |mobiledev|.

m.Logging = 1;

%%
% The device is now transmitting sensor data. A pause is included to allow
% for some measurements to be made before moving to the next steps, but is
% not required for logging to occur.

pause(15);

%%
% At the start of logging, the device is lying flat on a table with the
% screen facing up. The positive Y-axis of the angular velocity sensor is
% defined to extend out from the top of the device. Positive roll of the 
% orientation sensor is defined as a clockwise rotation about the Y-axis
% when facing the positive direction of the axis. 

%%
% During logging, the device is turned face-up and face-down a few times
% about its Y-axis. This generates Y-axis changes in angular velocity and 
% roll changes in orientation. 

%% Stop acquiring data
% The |Logging| property is used again to have the device stop sending
% sensor data to |mobiledev|.

m.Logging = 0;

%% Retrieve logged data
% Each sensor's data can be accessed from the |mobiledev| object.
% Two different timestamp variables are created because the angular 
% velocity and orientation data may not be recorded by the device at the 
% same time.

[av, tav] = angvellog(m);
[o, to] = orientlog(m);

%% Plot raw sensor data
% The data of interest from the sensors are isolated into separate
% variables and plotted.

yAngVel = av(:,2);
roll = o(:, 3);
plot(tav, yAngVel, to, roll);
legend('Y Angular Velocity', 'Roll');
xlabel('Relative time (s)');

%%
% The data is plotted in seconds relative to |mobiledev|'s 
% |InitialTimestamp| property. This property provides the absolute time of 
% the first data point recorded by a sensor and sent to MATLAB. It acts as 
% the reference point for the timestamps of all sensor data accessed using
% functions such as |angvellog| and |orientlog|, which are given in seconds
% relative to InitialTimestamp.

%% Convert to absolute timestamps
% To convert all sensor timestamps into absolute timestamps, the
% InitialTimestamp value is converted into a |datetime| object. The
% individual sensor timestamps, which are in units of seconds, are
% converted into |seconds|. This simplifies the date arithmetic of turning
% relative timestamps into absolute timestamps.

tInit = datetime(m.InitialTimestamp, 'InputFormat', 'dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS');
tAngVel = tInit + seconds(tav);
tOrient = tInit + seconds(to);

%% Plot multiple sensors over absolute time
% Both sensors now have absolute timestamps represented using |datetime|.
% This makes it easy to visualize the actual time that significant events
% occurred in sensor readings.
%
% The orientation sensor uses units of degrees, while the angular velocity
% sensor uses units of radians per second. Before plotting again, |yAngVel|
% is converted to degrees per second. 

yAngVelDeg = yAngVel * 180/pi;

plot(tAngVel, yAngVelDeg, tOrient, roll);
legend('Y Angular Velocity', 'Roll');
xlabel('Absolute time (s)');


%% Clean up
% Turn off the enabled sensors and clear |mobiledev|.

%m.AngularVelocitySensorEnabled = 0;
%m.OrientationSensorEnabled = 0;

%clear m;
